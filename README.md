iFiler is a file manager for iPhone.  iFiler can transfer files through Airdrop, and can read files(including the extension format of *.txt, *.pdf, *.rtf, *.doc, *.xls, *.ppt etc). 

iFiler is like the Resource Manager on Windows, it's able to go through file(s) you want to see.

If you runs iFiler on a jailbroken iPhone and  it works well more than a unjailbroken iPhone.
